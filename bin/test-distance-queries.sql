-- Test Distance Queries for Places Table
-- This file contains working examples for spatial queries using the correct column names

-- Example coordinates for testing:
-- New York City: -74.0060, 40.7128
-- Los Angeles: -118.2437, 34.0522
-- Chicago: -87.6298, 41.8781
-- San Francisco: -122.4194, 37.7749

-- 1. Find venues within 10 miles of New York City, ordered by distance
SELECT

-- 4. Get coordinates as latitude/longitude (from PostGIS location column)
SELECT 
  title,
  ST_Y(location::geometry) as latitude,
  ST_X(location::geometry) as longitude,
  city,
  state
FROM places

SELECT

-- 6. Count venues by city (to see data distribution)
SELECT
