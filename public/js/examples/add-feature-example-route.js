/**
 * Complete Example: Adding a New Route
 * 
 * Here's a complete example of the process to add a new route:
 * 
 * 1. Create the HTML view file in /views/your-feature.html
 * 2. Create an initializer function in page-initializers.js:
 *    
 *    export function initYourFeaturePage() {
 *      // Initialize the page
 *    }
 *    
 * 3. Add the route to the routes object in router.js:
 *    
 *    const routes = createRoutes({
 *      // Existing routes...
 *      
 *      '/your-feature': {
 *        viewPath: '/views/your-feature.html',
 *        afterRender: initYourFeaturePage,
 *        requireAuth: true // If needed
 *      }
 *    });
 *    
 * That's it! The route is now available at /your-feature
