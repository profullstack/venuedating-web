    <h2>2. Subscription Refunds</h2>
    <p>We offer the following refund options for our subscription services:</p>
    
    <h3>2.1 Cancellation Within 14 Days</h3>
    <p>If you cancel your subscription within 14 days of the initial purchase (the "cooling-off period"), you are eligible for a full refund of your subscription fee. This cooling-off period gives you time to evaluate our services and determine if they meet your needs.</p>
    
    <h3>2.2 Cancellation After 14 Days</h3>
    <p>If you cancel your subscription after the 14-day cooling-off period, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle, and no refund will be provided for the remainder of that period. You will not be charged for subsequent billing cycles.</p>

      <li>Service credits for future use</li>
